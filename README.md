# Programming Projects Repository

This repository serves as a collection of the programming projects developed throughout my academic journey in fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. It includes assignments and personal developments primarily conducted during my Master's degree studies. Below is a brief overview of what you'll find here:

## Structure
The repository is divided into three main sections based on the programming languages and tools used:

- **C++**: Projects focused on object-oriented programming, algorithms, and data structures. Topics include advanced programming techniques, polymorphism, and inheritance.
  
- **Python**: A wide variety of projects ranging from machine learning models to robotics simulations. Includes work on humanoid robots, reinforcement learning, and deep learning frameworks.
  
- **MATLAB/Octave**: Simulations and computational tasks related to control systems, signal processing, and mathematical modeling.

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to showcase the projects and programming skills I have developed during my academic and professional journey. It highlights my ability to solve technical problems in a structured and efficient way while using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Tools & Technologies
The projects in this repository utilize:
- C++ for robust and high-performance software solutions.
- Python for its versatility in data processing, AI, and robotics.
- MATLAB/Octave for precise simulations and mathematical computations.

## Collaboration
While most of these projects are individual or assigned during coursework, some were developed collaboratively with peers, showcasing teamwork and collaborative problem-solving. These represent the most complete and complex projects I have worked on, and they can be found directly in the list of my popular repositories.
